- use JavaScript to make the navigation bar functional.
- do Not Use Any Framework. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## My process

Looking at the CSS and HTML I was provided, the best and easiest way to make this responsive was desktop instead of my preferred mobile first approach. I then reimagined the desktop flow on a mobile and used media queries to make the page responsive.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flex

### What I learned

- Position can be replaced using flex.

### Continued development

I will be focusing on completing all Zuri Training challenges
